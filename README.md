ðŸ“± **Smartphone Price Prediction and Clustering**
Welcome to the Smartphone Price Prediction and Clustering project! This repository contains machine learning models and data preprocessing techniques applied to a dataset of smartphone specifications for predicting the price_range and exploring clusters within the data.

ðŸ“‚ **Project Overview**
This project demonstrates how to:

Preprocess and clean data: Handling missing values, scaling features, and selecting features for modeling.
Train and evaluate models for price range prediction using supervised learning techniques like SVM and Decision Trees.
Perform clustering analysis using K-Means and evaluate clusters using the silhouette score.
